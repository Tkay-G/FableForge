This project is an attempt at creating something big
with my python knowldegde  and my learning from courses
of how backend works

Aside from that, its a project geared to appeal to the 
webnovel communities. A space where indie authors can 
thrive and readers can find true hidden gems or new
books to really fall in love with.

The main idea was to create a space where indie authors 
no matter what, would be the highlight of the space.
Sure sites like webnovel exist but it's really biased
A lot of people might find it hard to even breakthrough
the ranks of sites like Royal Road as well, although I 
personally find it to be the better of the two.

Thats why I'm creating my site; FableForge.

Where authors and readers alike can connect 
in a shared space where no-one is truly overshadowing 
the other, new names and new faces.

I hope you all like the idea and stick around to see it 
come to fruition
